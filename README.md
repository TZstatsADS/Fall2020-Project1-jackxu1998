### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by Henan Xu

+ Project summary: The United States of America has an endured history of a diverse population. In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. Immigration has always been a central topic in various aspects of the life of American people, including their culture, way of living and of course their political inclinations. In the meantime, China's rise in recent decades has also been rather controversial for the Americans. Therefore, this study, which makes use of the 2016 ANES Time Series Study data, is aimed to explore how the American's stance on immigration and China problems relate to each other and their voting in the 2016 Election. Specifically, this study tries to provide answers to the following questions:

1. How are the Americans' opinions about immigration related to how likely they think immigrants take away jobs?

2. How are the Americans' attitudes toward immigration and China related?

3. Do the Americans' stands on immigration result in a specific pattern regarding who they vote for presidency?

4. Do the Americans' stands on China result in a specific pattern regarding who they vote for presidency?
